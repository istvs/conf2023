#### Conference updates | Thu 2023-03-09

We are excited about two conference updates\
\
**Technical tour** // [Military Institute of Automotive and Armour Technology](https://www.witpis.eu/pl/), Sulejówek, near Warsaw. The tour will include a short presentation, visiting outdoor laboratories, and a presentation of test stands and vehicles. The tour will be followed by a visit to [Kazimierz Dolny](https://www.kazimierz-dolny.pl/turystyka/), with an opportunity for sightseeing and dinner in a restaurant.\
\
**Pre-conference short course — Elements of off-road vehicle design, dynamics, and terramechanics** // The Lublin conference committee has scheduled a one-day technical course to precede the conference, on October 10. Confirmed presentation on _Off-Road Vehicle Design Fundamentals_ by [Dr. Zbigniew Kiernicki](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=pl\&as\_sdt=2007\&as\_vis=1\&q=Zbigniew+kiernicki\&btnG=), Lublin University of Technology, Poland, and other presenters to be announced.\
\
~~**Deadline for submissions** // Next week, March 15.~~ [~~Submit now~~](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=istvs2023)~~.~~\
~~~~Deadline for submissions now Thu 2023-03-30 _(updated Thu 2023-03-16)_

## Overview

The conference is an opportunity to present and disseminate the latest scientific and technological achievements in the field of vehicle-terrain systems.

Both representatives of science in the field of mechanical engineering, vehicles and machines, mechatronics and automation, soil science, agriculture and environmental engineering, as well as professionals from industry, business environment and government agencies for whom the issues discussed at the conference are an important merit are invited to participate. The organizers also count on the participation of students from under- and postgraduate courses.

The intention of the organizers is to create a friendly atmosphere and comfortable conditions for holding plenary sessions, focusing on the following issues:

* soil and other deformable traction substrates including Martian and lunar regolith, snow, moschus, etc., mechanical characterization for advanced field mobility modeling as well as for minimizing the effects of soil compaction and erosion, with particular emphasis on the impact of weather factors;
* driving systems of vehicles and machines, including innovative concepts of tires, wheels, and tracks for energy-saving traction;
* propulsion systems, engines, mechatronic systems, and vetronics to meet the high requirements of individual customers as well as increasingly stringent environmental protection standards;
* issues of regolith research of celestial bodies, the moon, Mars, asteroids for practical solutions in the field of mobility, autonomous, and robotic systems;
* metrology in terramechanics, in particular new solutions for remote, autonomous measurements, using AI and maintenance-free devices and systems;
* off-road vehicle dynamics;
* manned and unmanned vehicles including off-road robots;
* issues in the field of terramechanics and vehicle-terrain systems not mentioned above.
