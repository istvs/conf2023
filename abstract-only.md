### 0146 / Evaluation and estimation of traction performance for 78 kW agricultural tractor by tillage implements using field measurement system

Yi-Seo Min, Yeon-Soo Kim, and Wan-Soo Kim

Abstract: Tractors use different types of plows depending on tillage operation characteristics, and the plow implements is utilized at different working depth conditions. The shape of the plow significantly affect the tractor’s traction performance. This study aims to estimate the tractor’s traction performance according to the three different type of plow implements. The experiment used a 78kW tractor and three tillage implements (moldboard plow, chisel plow, and subsoiler). The tractor was equipped with a measurement system that included a four-wheel torque meter, a six-component load cell, a global positioning system (GPS) and a data acquisition system (DAQ) to measure the tractor’s traction performance. The widths of the moldboard plow, chisel plow, and subsoiler were 2.8, 2.8, and 2.095 m, respectively. During the operation, the gear stages for the moldboard plow and chisel plow were M3 Low (7.09 km/h), while for the subsoiler, it was L3 Low (2.38 km/h). The results showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) of the dynamic traction ratio according to the slip ratio was high in the order of chisel plow (R2:0.79), moldboard plow (R2:0.71), and subsoiler (R2:0.48), and the R2 of traction efficiency according to slip ratio was high in order of subsoiler (R2:0.99), moldboard plow (R2:0.96), and chisel plow (R2:0.91). These results suggest that estimating the tractor's traction performance using the slip ratio is highly accurate. However, the study's limitation is that it did not consider various working conditions such as gear stages and ground conditions. Therefore, future experiments are planned to address these limitations and improve the accuracy of the traction performance estimation.

Abstract: The objective of this article is to estimate the power delivery efficiency and fuel consumption based on engine modes. In this study, 95-kW powershift tractor was used to analyze the power delivery and estimate the fuel consumption during agricultural operations. The asphalt driving, plow and rotary tillage were conducted for the field the experiment at the engine modes of conventional, APS (Auto power shift) power, and APS ECO. To analyze the field condition, soil hardness, and soil water content were measured as well as soil sample was collected from the experimental site to analyze the soil texture using the USDA soil texture triangle. It is observed that the engine required powers at various engines have a significant different of the asphalt driving, plow, and rotary tillage. However, the axle powers at all engine modes for each operation showed almost similar due to the similar forward speed of the tractor. In case of fuel consumption, it was found that the fuel consumption at each engine mode has a significant different. It was also observed the APS ECO mode was the most economic compared to the conventional and APS power for the asphalt driving, plow and rotary tillage. Therefore, we recommend by this study to the users to perform the tractor at APS ECO engine mode for asphalt driving, plow, and rotary tillage considering fuel economic and high working load.

### 1615 / Development of soil physical characteristics automation measurement system for agricultural field digitalization

Si Eon Lee and Wan Soo Kim

Abstract: The physical characteristics of soil have a significant impact on the growth of crops and the performance of agricultural machinery operating in soil conditions, but study on sensor development is insufficient. Existing methods collect data individually using a single sensor to measure soil physical properties. This requires a high labor a lot of time, and it is difficult to secure consistency in measurement, so a new measurement system is needed. The aim of this study is to develop an automated measurement system for soil physical properties. The software was developed based on LabVIEW, and the developed soil automation measurement system is a tractor-attached type. The developed soil physical property measurement equipment consists of a load cell and distance sensor to measure soil strength by depth, a moisture sensor to measure soil moisture content, temperature and electrical conductivity, and a slope sensor to measure soil shear force. The cone index, an indicator of soil strength, is the average force per unit area required to push a cone-shaped probe into the soil. ASAE standard was applied as the design standard for this. The tractor 3-point hitch is controlled by the user's operation, the lifting/lowering part of each sensing unit driven by the motor and reducer installed in the soil automation measuring unit is controlled, and the physical properties of the soil are measured. Experiments were measured in the Korean paddy soil field (30 m x 100 m), which was mapped using GIS software. Verification showed that the developed system showed a range similar to the result value manually. So that the developed system is expected to can measure soil physical characteristics in a very short time compared to manual work and be useful for digitizing agricultural fields.
