Zhen Chen, Meng Zou, Dong Pan, Baofeng Yuan, and Lining Chen

Abstract: Due to the complex situation on the surface of Mars and the long delay of signal transmission between Mars and the Earth, many rovers of different countries have experienced the situation of reduced mobility or even failed exploration missions due to climbing process on Mars. In order to avoid such a situation, this paper takes ‘Zhurong’ Rover as an example. Four kinds of climbing modes that it can use are analyzed namely normal climbing, Z-type climbing, oblique climbing, bionic wriggle climbing. The advantages and disadvantages of four kinds of climbing modes and their applicable scope are compared. When the slope is small, normal climbing should be used. When the slope is moderate, Z-type and oblique climbing should be used. When the slope is large, bionic wriggle climbing should be used. Through the experiment, the critical value of the rover climbing slope is 23°, when the rover climbing slope is greater than 23°, the normal can not climbing normally which should be backward downhill. In addition, the current criterion other than the slope criterion is given to improve the climbing efficiency and safety of the rover under different climbing modes. The critical value of the current is 1.92 A. the research results can provide experimental data and reference for the in-orbit use of ‘Zhurong’ Rover.
