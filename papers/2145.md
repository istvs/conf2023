Abstract: The field tests of the forward obstacle negotiation performance of Zhurong Rover can provide data support and trafficability assessment basis for its safe patrol in the Mars complicated environment. Based on the terramechanics method, using Zhurong Rover ground simulation; Taking the velocity, height and number of stones as influence factor, the Mechanism power and electrical current as experimental indices, Carrying out the field tests of the Mars Rover's forward obstacle negotiation performance. Combining experiment and theoretical analysis, the final obstacle crossing ability h / D of Zhurong Mars rover is higher than 0.5.The influence of test factors on power, current and trafficability is analyzed and compared. The results indicate that Regular power and current changes can provide a basis for judging when the Zhurong Rover will obstacle negotiation and whether it can pass; The three test factors have a positive correlation with the change of the vehicle power and current, and the main order of the influence of the three test factors on the test index is: the driving speed > the number of obstacles > the height of stones. When the speed increases from 50m/h to 100m/h and 200m/h, the impact on the average power increase is 50%-200%, and the impact on the average current increase is 20%-60%. When the number of stones increases from 0 to 6, the average power increases by 20-30% and the average current increases by 19-25%. The average power of 100mm and 200mm increases by 0%-10% and 10-20% compared with 50mm. The average power and current increase is 10-20%. The results show that the rover has good obstacle-crossing performance and can cross 200mm obstacles. Its wheel structure and mechanism Settings can cope with the harsh driving environment.
