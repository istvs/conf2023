Title: Experiments of singkage characters of wire mesh wheel under different slip ratios

Authors: Wang Yang, Zou Meng, and Li Jianqiao

Abstract: Results of the experiments of sinkage characters of wire mesh wheel under different slip ratios showed that: The sinkage increased with slip ratio, the height of ruts decreased with the increase of slip ratio, while lunar soil simulant was under different prepared conditions; The sinkage and the height of ruts both increased, when lunar soil simulant changed from compact to soft. Experiments of ruts surface scan of wire mesh wheel showed that, the max sinkage of rut increased firstly and then decreased, the max negative sinkage of rut increased, the shear-ing action of terrain increased, the surface of rut was destroyed gradually, with the increase of slip ratio. The results provided basic experimental data for evaluating the sinkage of lunar rover and the physical and mechani-cal characteristics of lunar soil simulant through the ruts of wire mesh wheel.
