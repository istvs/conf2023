Abstract: This study analyses experimental data of stress state in sandy soil captured with the SST (Stress State Transducer) in field experiments. Based on measured soil pressures, soil stresses in the orthogonal and octahedral planes were determined at the depth of 20 cm beneath the test vehicles’ right track. Three different tracked vehicles of masses — 44.3, 12.13, and 9.7 Mg — were used in the experiment. Effects of road wheel loads distribution, ride velocity, and pulling with track slip on soil stress state were determined and analyzed. The experimental data were compared with analytical predictions based on Boussinesq theory as well as the Mean Maximum Pressure (MMP) and Nominal Ground Pressure (NGP) models.
