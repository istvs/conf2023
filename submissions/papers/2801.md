Title: Online soil property estimation for autonomous earthmoving using physics-infused neural networks

Abstract: We present a novel learning-based method for online estimation of soil properties using a physics-infused neural network. The network is trained to produce estimates of soil cohesion and angle of internal friction which are then passed through an earthmoving model, based on the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE) to produce an estimated force. The network ingests a short history of sensory observations including depth images and the blade trajectory along with past control commands. In contrast to previous work that assumes that many of the other FEE parameters are fixed or known by other means, we expect this approach to enable estimation of the remaining parameters, including those describing the geometry of the cut. To validate our approach, we developed an earthmoving simulation of a bladed vehicle using Vortex Studio, and plan to compare estimates produced by our learning-based method to those generated using a conventional Newton-Raphson based optimization technique. Although difficult in real world experiments, we will analyze the absolute accuracy of both methods using pseudo-ground truth values of the soil properties obtained from the simulation. We believe our approach will reduce the need for terrain maps, improve the estimation of the geometric FEE parameters, enable dynamic estimation of the previously fixed parameters, and ideally lead to improved soil property estimates. We are currently in the process of conducting experiments to verify the approach and its benefits.
