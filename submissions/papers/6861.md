Title: Researches on airplane performance on a grass airfield

Authors: Jaroslaw Pytka, Paweł Tomiło, and Mateusz Klepka

Abstract: The paper presents research for the development of a synthetic model describing the airfield performance of an aircraft operating from a grass runway. Starting from the basic terramechanical description of the wheel performance, a methodology of experimental research was developed and airfield measurements (take-off and landing distance) were carried out on a grass airfield, taking into account important factors, such as soil Cone Index, soil moisture, vegetation density and atmospheric factors. Initially, simple autoregressive models describing the relationship between the aircraft performance and the above parameters were obtained. The overarching goal is to implement the obtained models into the GARFIELD grass airfield information system. The GARFIELD system uses a database of general aviation airplanes with technical data required to calculate airfield performance as well as a soil database covering the European Union territory. Finally, the system is linked with an online weather service to have past, current, and future meteorological conditions to simulate the mechanical strength of grass runway on a given airfield that, in turn, is needed to predict wheel performance and calculate takeoff or landing distances. A general purpose of the system is to incorporate grass airfields into a regular air transportation system by determining their suitability for flight operations and by disseminating that information in text or coded format to airmen. The paper focuses on the presentation of the developed methods and the results of the measurements carried out, and also describes the assumptions of the GARFIELD system.
